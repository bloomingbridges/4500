# 4500æ–‡

A desktop client for Tofugu's ["4,500 Japanese Sentences"](https://store.tofugu.com/shop/4500-japanese-sentences)

I've been meaning to work through those ever since I bought them in 2019[Citation Needed], but for some reason I keep forgetting they exist on my drive.. Neither did I want to print them all out.

So in order to save the planet and finally be able to get into a routine of analysing Japanese sentences I wrote a smol (in terms of functionality) application, that ..

- I could leave running in the background without annoying me
- would notify me every day about its existence via native notifications and
- could maybe sync my progress with other machines in my household.

The app is already usable (see the Releases section), just missing the following features:

## TODO

- Add window showing all entered translations
- Add sync option for devices on local network
- Add daily notification reminder
- Make **KILL SCREEN** more satisfying
